We have a dataset with user actions, a technical specification and several auxiliary datasets. We need to: assess test execution correctness; analyse test results and check test audience overlap with competing test and coincidence of test and marketing events.
| Gross errors in the test were detected, their causes and recommendations for avoiding them were given. A discrepancy was found between the test and the provided terms of reference. The z-test was also used to evaluate the results in the test and control groups|
