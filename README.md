| [1. Loss analysis of the ProcrastinatePRO+ application](https://github.com/ritacn/-Yandex-Projects-/tree/main/ProcrastinationPro)|  Despite a huge investment in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the past few months.  Our goal is to analyze marketing data  of the entertainment app Procrastinate Pro+ and figure out the reasons of the loss and help the company turn it into a profit. | Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Seaborn, Сohort Analysis,Product Metrics |
| [2. Predicting the probability of user churn for fitness centres](https://github.com/ritacn/-Yandex-Projects-/tree/main/Fitness%20club%20attendance%20database%20analysis)| Using the database of clients of fitness club and Machine Learning tools, predict the probability of churn for each client, extract information about the most prominent groups of clients that may affect the churn| Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Classification, Clustering, Machine Learning |
| [3. AB testing result analysis ]([https://github.com/ritacn/-Yandex-Projects-/tree/main/Fitness%20club%20attendance%20database%20analysis](https://github.com/ritacn/-Yandex-Projects-/tree/main/AB%20test%20result%20analysis))| An AB test was held, but our management is not satisfied with its result. Our task is to evaluate test results, using dataset with user actions, a technical specification and several auxiliary datasets and assess test execution correctness |Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Seaborn, Scipy.Stats, Math  |
| [4.
