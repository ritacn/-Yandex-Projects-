| Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Classification, Clustering, Machine Learning | Based on the fitness chain's visitor data, predict the probability of churn for each customer in the next month, generate user portraits using clustering |In this project I used machine learning. Predicted the probability of of churn (at the level of the next month) for each client; typical portraits of users were formed: the most prominent groups were singled out and characterised portraits of users: the most prominent groups are highlighted and their their main attributes and analysed the main attributes which most strongly influence the churn outflow. |
